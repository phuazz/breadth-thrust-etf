"""Tests for the pure helpers in scripts/scheduled_refresh.py.

The subprocess/git orchestration is exercised operationally (preflight
smoke run at setup, then the soak Saturdays); these tests pin the date
logic and the commit-message contract. Month- and year-boundary cases
per CLAUDE.md date rules. Python date months are 1-indexed.
